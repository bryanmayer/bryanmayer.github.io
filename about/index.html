            <h1>About me??</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I am an epidemiologist and biostatistician who studies HIV vaccine candidates.  I love R and primarily use it for all of my research (although I do use python sometimes).  This blog is where I share small side projects I work on, whether they are related to my research or something for fun.
