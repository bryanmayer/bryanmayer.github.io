            <h1>About me??</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I am an epidemiologist and biostatistician who studies a variety infectious diseases.  I love R and primarily use it for all of my research (although I do use python sometimes).  
            <BR>
            <p>I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the 
            <a href="http://research.fhcrc.org/schiffer/en.html">Schiffer Lab</a> working on several
            projects.  My current project focuses analyzing primary infection of CMV in infants.  I'm also analyzing household shedding rates and transmission of several herpesviruses: CMV, EBV, HSV, and HHV6.  I have also studied the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676470"> kinetics of bacteria in the vaginal microbiota</a> during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_vaginosis"> bacterial vaginosis.</a></p>
            <BR>
            <p> Though I currently reside in Seattle, I carry a lot of hometown pride for my homeland of Michigan. </p>
