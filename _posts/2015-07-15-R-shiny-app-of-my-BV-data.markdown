Last week, I took a workshop with the one and only Hadley Wickham learning about data visualization!
As part of the course we learned about shiny and so I turned one of the figures from my [recent publication on 
bacterial vaginosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676470) into a 
[shiny app hosted on shinyapps.io](https://bryanmayer.shinyapps.io/BV-time-series).


My code is up on github: [https://github.com/bryanmayer/BV\_data\_figure](https://github.com/bryanmayer/BV_data_figure):
