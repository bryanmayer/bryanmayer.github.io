Spent a little time learning about the [Peter Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle) today and found an agent-based model of company promotion strategies.  




The optimal strategy? Promoting by random.

(Side note: I have reservations about agent-based models because, without proper constraints and training, they can be parameterized to basically find any result.  Having said that, I did not scrutinize the methods of this paper.)
